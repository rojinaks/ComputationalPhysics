\section{Uncertainty Dependency of $X$ and $P$}\label{sec:3}
Now we focus on how the uncertainty changes as a function of $X$ and $P$.
The $\pi$ values were calculated for 16 different combinations of point- and
experiment count. The results are shown in \cref{tab:ex1.5_pi_values} with
the corresponding histograms for the $\pi_x$ distributions.
It is easy to see that for a constant $P$ the uncertainty does not
change with higher $X$ which is surprising, because it means that for a
given number of generated points the $\pi$ value cannot be made
more precise with higher experiment count. The uncertainties for every
$P$ are shown in \cref{fig:uncertainty_function_of_x}. On the other hand
are correlation between the uncertainty and $P$ for constant $X$
is visible. For the log-log plot in \cref{fig:uncertainty_function_of_p} a linear
function would be a good approximation and thus we can write
$$ \log \text{err}(P) = -n\log P + b$$
with $b, n > 0$. This results in the relation
$$\text{err}(P) = \frac{\mathrm{e}^b}{P^n}$$
for the uncertainty. This function will not be fitted to the data but from visual
inspections it is clear that the same relation with same parameters $b$ and $n$
will hold for every $X$. \par
With this information we can conclude that the most efficient way to calculate
$pi$ with a given $PX$ is to maximize $P$ and keep $X$ small, although From
\cref{sec:1} it is known that $X$ has to be atleast bigger than $1$.
